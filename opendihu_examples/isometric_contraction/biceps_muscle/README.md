# Bayesian Optimization for a biceps muscle model

## Setup
- A dummy biceps muscle geometry. 
- The solvers for both stretching and contraction are coupled mechanics solver and fastmonodomain solver. In the prestretch process we set dynamic to `False` and add boundary conditions that simulate the muscle being fixed at one side and being pulled at from the other side. In the contraction process we set dynamic to `True` and fix both ends of the muscle in place by boundary conditions. 
- It uses the electrophysiology CellML model "hodgkin_huxley-razumova" and the incompressible mechanics model "Mooney-Rivlin".
- No preCICE involved. 
- With Bayesian Optimization we are looking for the prestretch force that yields the largest contraction force of the muscle

## How to run
To run a single simulation of stretching and contracting a muscle, go to build_release and run:
```
./muscle_contraction_with_prestretch ../settings_contraction_with_prestretch.py incompressible_mooney_rivlin 10.0
```
